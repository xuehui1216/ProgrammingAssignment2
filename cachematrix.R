## Write a short comment describing this function
# cacheSolve cacalculates the inverse of the special "matrix" created with the makeCacheMatrix function
#However, it first checks to see if the inverse has already been calculated. 
#If so, it gets the inverse from the cache and skips the computation. 
#Otherwise, it calculates the inverse of the matrix and sets the value of the inverse in the cache via the setinverse function.
